## 1. Development Methodology

### 1.1 Chosen Methodology

- Rapid development with clear deliverable milestones
- 3-day timeline with focused completion of major components:
  - Data retrieval and preparation
  - Word embedding training
  - Prediction model development
  - API implementation
  - Containerisation
  - Deployment
- Daily standups to review progress and address blockers
- Emphasis on learning ML concepts whilst meeting deliverables

### 1.2 Team Structure

- Small team of ML newcomers with varied technical backgrounds
- Clear component ownership with collaborative learning sessions
- Monolithic architecture with logical module boundaries to manage complexity

## 2. Coding Standards

### 2.1 General Coding Principles

- Prioritise readability and maintainability over optimisation
- Follow PEP 8 coding style for all Python code
- Use flake8 linter in VS Code to enforce standards
- Apply KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles throughout
- Use type hints where appropriate to improve code clarity
- Apply clear separation between data access, model, and API layers
- Utilise descriptive variable and function names that reflect purpose
- Use comments sparingly, only when code is not self-explanatory
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Limit function complexity (aim for <25 lines per function)
- Maintain modular design with clear interfaces between components

### 2.2 Language-Specific Standards

#### 2.2.1 Python Standards

- Python 3.13.3 as standard language version
- Consistent import ordering: standard library, third-party, local
- Use of environment variables for configuration
- Error handling with appropriate exception types
- No wildcard imports (avoid `from module import *`)

#### 2.2.2 PyTorch Standards

- Layer definitions should follow PyTorch conventions
- Use nn.Module for model components
- Consistent tensor dimensioning and device handling
- Clear separation between model definition and training loop
- Explicit handling of model states (train/eval modes)

#### 2.2.3 FastAPI Standards

- RESTful API design following project brief
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Clear endpoint path naming
- Consistent HTTP status codes and error responses
- Proper request/response documentation

#### 2.2.4 Database Standards

- Use of PostgreSQL connection pooling for efficiency
- Parameterised queries to prevent SQL injection
- Explicit transaction management
- Clear data model definitions

### 2.3 Code Review Process

- Feature branch PRs require at least one reviewer before merging
- Focus reviews on correctness, maintainability, and adherence to standards
- Use collaborative sessions for knowledge sharing during reviews
- Prioritise quick feedback loops to maintain development momentum

## 3. Version Control

### 3.1 Repository Management

- Feature branch workflow:
  - Main branch protected, no direct commits
  - Create feature branches for each component or feature
  - Use pull requests to merge changes back to main
  - Delete feature branches after successful merge
- Regular commits to facilitate collaboration and code reviews

### 3.2 Commit Standards

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Clear, descriptive commit messages following the format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix nor add features
  - `test:` for adding or modifying tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- Logical, atomic commits that represent complete changes
- Include reference to project component in commit message
- Avoid committing sensitive information (connection strings, credentials)

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Testing Types

- Model evaluation:
  - Test set evaluation with MSE metrics (target: MSE < 20.0)
  - Comparison against baseline models
  - Validation on representative examples
- API testing:
  - Endpoint functionality tests
  - Response time measurements
  - Error handling validation
- Integration testing:
  - End-to-end pipeline validation
  - Database interaction testing

### 4.2 Test Coverage

- Focus on critical paths:
  - Word embedding quality
  - Prediction accuracy
  - API response correctness
  - Data flow through the system
- Manual validation acceptable given timeline constraints

### 4.3 Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - Verify model loading
  - Test API endpoints
  - Check database connectivity
  - Validate Docker container startup
  - Deploy to target environment on successful tests

## 5. Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Code Quality

- Use of flake8 for basic code quality
- Regular code walkthroughs for knowledge sharing
- Focus on maintainability and clarity given the learning context
- Documentation of known limitations and design decisions

### 5.2 Performance Monitoring

- Track key performance metrics:
  - Model inference time (target: <1 second)
  - API response time (target: <1 second)
  - Database query performance
  - Model prediction accuracy (MSE)
- Log latency measurements for each prediction request

## 6. Technical Debt Management

### 6.1 Identification

- Document known limitations in project README
- Track prioritised improvements in a simple backlog
- Distinguish between learning opportunities and critical fixes
- Focus on completing core functionality before optimisation

### 6.2 Mitigation Strategies
